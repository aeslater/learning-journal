# Operators & Loops
---
### Comparison Operators
Make these into flashcards:

`==		IS EQUAL TO`

`!=		IS NOT EQUAL TO`

`===		STRICT EQUAL TO`

`!==		STRICT NOT EQUAL TO`

`>		GREATER THAN`

`<		LESS THAN`

`>=		GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO`

`<=		LESS THAN OR EQUAL TO`

`&&		LOGICAL AND`

`||		LOGICAL OR`

`!		LOGICAL NOT`

`++     INCREMENT`

`--     DECREMENT`

### Loops
For loops run a specified number of times, usually using a counter inside to determine when to stop.
While loops continue to run while a specified condition is true.

Do while loops are the same as while loops except it will run at least once even if the condition is false. Some example code that will write the numbers 0 through 9 is shown below. Every time the loop runs, the `i++` operator adds one to the value of i.

`var i;`

`for (var i = 0; I < 10; i++) {`

`   document.write(i);`

`}`
