[How Computers Work - Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdnOPI1iJNcsRwJhvksEo1tJqjIqWbN-)

Here are several things I learned from the playlist How Computers Work.

### Circuits
Circuits take input in the form of 0's and 1's and convert them into a different result, also in the form of 0's and 1's. Complicated circuits can take multiple inputs or signals and combine them to achieve the desired result. 

One type of circuit is an adder - two bits in and two bits out, can be combined to add much larger numbers.

### Binary Code
Computers store information using binary code, which consists of 0's and 1's. One thing I learned was that you can represent a number over 4 billion with just 32 wires or 32 places in the binary number system (8 bits can store numbers up to 255, which is eight 1's.) 

### Operating System
An operating system controls the other software on the computer and lets you install new software. It decides when other programs get to use the CPU and quickly switches between programs to allow them all share the CPU for fractions of a second at a time.
