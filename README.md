**Hi, my name is Ashley.**

A growth mindset is believing that I can learn and choosing to learn.

Three things I can remember to keep myself in a growth mindset:

    1. When I get stuck (and I will), persist! Try a new approach, read existing code, Google it, talk it through, be methodical and persistent.
    2. When someone else is better than me, cheer for them! And aspire to improve.
    3. When criticized, listen. 
    
My kids learn growth mindset at school and we use the word "yet" often at home. So often, in fact, that my youngest uses it inappropriately.

> *Not **yet**.*
