### P. 43 – 69 How Do I Write a Script for a Web Page?

JavaScript is not an actual coding language; it is an interpreted scripting language that makes webpages dynamic and interactive. As with CSS code, best practice is to keep JS code in a separate file and not in your HTML. 

To link your JavaScript file to your HMTL, place the following code just before the closing `</body>` tag.

`<script type="text/JavaScript" src="js/script.js"></script>`

### New vocabulary:
* Statement (starts on a new line and ends in a semicolon)
* Variable (declare it, assign value, can change/vary)

For example `document.write('Hello')`
* Object (document)
* Method (write())
* Parameter ('Hello')



### Data Types
* Numeric - 0.85
* String - "I'm hungry." or '0.85'
* Boolean - true or false
